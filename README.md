# ANA680 - Joseph Allibone
This repository contains all assignments and hands-on activities in my ANA680 Machine Learning Deployment course. The primary goal is to build, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models using real-world deployment techniques.

The repository is organized by weekly assignments. Each week's folder includes relevant datasets, raw Python scripts, and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files. This structure makes it easy to follow along with the course progression and keeps all components for each assignment in one place.
